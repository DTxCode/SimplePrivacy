A privacy tool that's easy to use.

## Development

### Commands
 - `npm run serve` start local dev server
 - `npm run build` build site using dev configs
 - `npm run build-prod` build site using prod configs

### Todo:
 - Write component tests
 - Update main UI flow to make lock vs unlock clearer
 - Check OS/Browser compatibility
 - Support for folders
 - Support for compression

### Issues:
 - Can only decrypt PGP messages that were encrypted by OpenPGP.js
